Machine learning algorithms

Requires CERN's ROOT package to be installed as it is used for plotting, random numbers, and other features:
https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.14.04.source.tar.gz

To run scripts within this directory, log into the root shell (simply type root -l in the terminal if installed) 
and run the following command:

.x name_of_script.cpp++

For example, if one wants to see the naive bayes classification code, change
directory to bayes_classifier, enter the root shell (type root), and run

.x bayes_classifier.cpp++
