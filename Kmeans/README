Requires CERN's ROOT package to be installed as it is used for plotting, random numbers, and other drawing features:
https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.14.04.source.tar.gz

Assuming ROOT is installed, log into the root shell (type root -l in the terminal within this directory), and run

.x kmeans.cpp++

which will generate plots and append to animation.gif (by default).
